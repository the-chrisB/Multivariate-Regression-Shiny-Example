This is an example R Shiny app for predicting the concentrations of common phenolic compounds found in red wine from a given red wine sample.
To perform the analysis using a UV-visible spectrophotometer, the sample must be loaded into a cuvette along with model wine (11% ABV in water
acidified to pH 3.3 using 0.1 N HCL) for dilution.  The exact dilution needed will vary depending on the spectrophotometer being used.  For a 
Genesys 10S, the optimal dilution was 1 part wine to 5 parts model wine.
